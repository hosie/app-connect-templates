  description: >-
    Use this template to start a batch process using the scheduler node to
    retrieve leads from Salesforce Account 1 and then create or update leads in
    Salesforce Account 2. The flow will send a message to Slack to alert you
    when the batch process has started, and an email will be sent to your
    preferred email address with the status of the sync.
